# Objects as Parameters
-----------------------
	Learn about best practices for sending an object as a constructor parameter.

	We know that we can use constructor parameters to assign state to an object. Did you also know that we can send an object as a parameter to another object? In this article, we’ll 
	discuss how an object can be sent as a parameter as well as the best practices for accomplishing that.

	* Using an Object as a Parameter
	--------------------------------
	First, let’s create a class called Cupcake:

		class Cupcake {
  			String flavor;
  			boolean sprinkles;
 
  			public Cupcake(String type, boolean hasSprinkles) {
    				flavor = type;
    				sprinkles = hasSprinkles;
  			}
		}

	Now, we’ll create a class called Bakery whose constructor accepts an object of Cupcake as a parameter:

		class Bakery {
  			Cupcake bakeryCupcake;
  			double price;
  			String giveTotal;
 
  			public Bakery(Cupcake cupcakeType, double priceOf) {
    				bakeryCupcake = cupcakeType;
    				price = priceOf;
    				giveTotal = "The " + bakeryCupcake.flavor + " cupcake is €" + price;
  			}
		}

	Inside the main() method of the Bakery class, we’ll create a new Cupcake object called chocolateSprinkle. Then, we’ll create a new Bakery object, called myBakery, that takes the 
	chocolateSprinkle object as a parameter:

		public static void main(String[] args) {
  			Cupcake chocolateSprinkle = new Cupcake("chocolate", true);
  			// Add your code below
  			Bakery myBakery = new Bakery(chocolateSprinkle, 3.25);
  			System.out.println(myBakery.giveTotal); 
		}

	When we run this program, we get the following output:

		The chocolate cupcake is €3.25

	* Creating a Copy of an Object
	------------------------------
	If we use an object as a parameter for a constructor method, it’s a good programming practice to not modify said object unless the situation requires it. If we do find ourselves 
	needing to modify an object sent as a parameter, we should set the instance variable to hold a copy of the referenced object instead of the original object.

	Let’s say we added the line bakeryCupcake.flavor = "vanilla";to our Bakery constructor that changes the flavor value of the chocolateSprinkle object to "vanilla".

		public Bakery(Cupcake cupcakeType, double priceOf) {
  			bakeryCupcake = cupcakeType;
  			// change cupcake object flavor to vanilla
  			bakeryCupcake.flavor = "vanilla";
  			price = priceOf;
  			giveTotal = "The " + bakeryCupcake.flavor + " cupcake is €" + price;  
		}

	What happens to the state of our original chocolateSprinkle object after we call the constructor of our Bakery object?

	Coding question
	---------------
	Run the following code. Then, uncomment line 21. Feel free to change the current value on line 21. After, run the code again.

	What happened to the state flavor for the object chocolateSprinkle? What about the state flavor for the parameter object bakeryCupcake?

class Cupcake {
  String flavor;
  boolean sprinkles;
  
  public Cupcake(String type, boolean hasSprinkles) {
    flavor = type;
    sprinkles = hasSprinkles;
  }
}

class Bakery {
  Cupcake bakeryCupcake;
  double price;
  String giveTotal;

  public Bakery(Cupcake cupcakeType, double priceOf) {
    bakeryCupcake = cupcakeType;
    price = priceOf;

    // Uncomment line below
    bakeryCupcake.flavor = "vanilla";
    giveTotal = "The " + bakeryCupcake.flavor + " cupcake is €" + price;
    
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Cupcake chocolateSprinkle = new Cupcake("chocolate", true);

    // Create an object that takes in an object as a parameter
    Bakery myBakery = new Bakery(chocolateSprinkle, 3.25);
    
    // Output a value of parameter object
    System.out.println("Our object sent as a parameter has a flavor value of "  + myBakery.bakeryCupcake.flavor);

    // Output a value of original object
    System.out.println("Our original object has a flavor value of " + chocolateSprinkle.flavor);
  }
}

	See how the Bakery constructor is impacting the flavor instance variable of our chocolateSprinkle object instead of only changing bakeryCupcake? Both of their flavor instance 
	variables now have a value of "vanilla".

	Why did this happen? When an object is sent as an argument, the value sent to the parameter is a reference to the original object and not a copy of the original object; therefore, 
	whenever we make a change to our parameter object, we are also making a change to our original object. Note that this doesn’t happen with primitive values because the parameter 
	value is initialized with a copy of the argument value.

	To only change the value of the parameter object and not the original object, we’ll discuss how to create a copy of an object.

	One way to create a copy of an object is to make a copy constructor. The copy constructor is an additional class constructor; remember, a class can have multiple constructors as 
	long as each constructor has its own unique signature. Copy constructors create a copy of an object by taking in an object and setting the values of the new object to the same 
	values of the parameter object.

	For example, we’ll add a copy constructor to the Cupcake class:

class Cupcake {
  String flavor;
  boolean sprinkles;
  // original constructor
  public Cupcake(String type, boolean hasSprinkles) {
    flavor = type;
    sprinkles = hasSprinkles;
  }
  // copy constructor
  public Cupcake(Cupcake copy) {
    flavor = copy.flavor;
    sprinkles = copy.sprinkles;
  }
}

	We now have a copy constructor, but in order to call it, we need to make a minor change to the Bakery constructor:

public Bakery(Cupcake cupcakeType, double priceOf) {
  // Create a copy Cupcake object
  Cupcake copy = new Cupcake(cupcakeType);
  // set bakeryCupcake to hold value of object copy
  bakeryCupcake = copy;
  price = priceOf;
  bakeryCupcake.flavor = "vanila";
  giveTotal = "The " + bakeryCupcake.flavor + " cupcake is €" + price;
}

	In our constructor, we created a new object, copy, that calls the copy constructor in order to create and store a copy of our parameter object cupcakeType. Then, we set our 
	instance variable, bakeryCupcake to store the value of copy.

	Now that we have a copy of the object, we don’t have to worry about an object sent as a parameter to the Bakery class changing the state of our Cupcake objects, like 
	chocolateSprinkle. By adding a copy constructor to our code, our output changes.

class Cupcake {
  String flavor;
  boolean sprinkles;
  
  public Cupcake(String type, boolean hasSprinkles) {
    flavor = type;
    sprinkles = hasSprinkles;

  }
  // copy constructor
  public Cupcake(Cupcake copy) {
    flavor = copy.flavor;
    sprinkles = copy.sprinkles;
  }
}

class Bakery {
  Cupcake bakeryCupcake;
  double price;
  String giveTotal;

  public Bakery(Cupcake cupcakeType, double priceOf) {
    // Create a copy Cupcake object
    Cupcake copy = new Cupcake(cupcakeType);
    // set bakeryCupcake to hold value of object copy
    bakeryCupcake = copy;
    price = priceOf;
    bakeryCupcake.flavor = "vanila";
    giveTotal = "The " + bakeryCupcake.flavor + " cupcake is €" + price;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Cupcake chocolateSprinkle = new Cupcake("chocolate", true);
    Bakery myBakery = new Bakery(chocolateSprinkle, 3.25);
    
    // Output a value of parameter object
    System.out.println("Our object sent as a parameter has a flavor of "  + myBakery.bakeryCupcake.flavor);

    // Output a value of original object
    System.out.println("Our original object has a flavor of " + chocolateSprinkle.flavor);
  }
}

	We now see an output that reflects that even though we changed the value of an object sent as an argument value, the state of our original object chocolateSprinkle remains 
	unchanged.

	Conclusion
	----------
	Nice job reaching the end of this article. Let’s recap what we learned:

		. Objects can be sent as a parameter to a constructor.

		. In order to avoid changing the state of the original object, it’s best practice to create a copy of the object sent as a parameter.

		. One method of copying an object is creating a copy constructor that copies the attributes of an object into a new object.
